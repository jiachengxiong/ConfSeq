## ‚ö° Online Access to ConfSeq-series Models

We provide ready-to-use ConfSeq-series models online at [Sciminer](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/), including:

* **Molecular Conformation Generation**: [ConfSeq-Conf-Gen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=Confseq%20Conf%20Gen)
* **Shape-conditioned Generation**: [ConfSeq-Shape-Gen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=ConfSeq%20Shape%20Gen)
* **Shape Screening Based on ConfSeq**: [ConfSeq-Shape-Screen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=ConfSeq%20Shape%20Screen)

## üì¶ Environment Setup

We strongly recommend creating a dedicated Conda environment to manage dependencies. Execute the following commands to create an environment named `confseq` with Python 3.11 and CUDA 12.6:

```bash
conda create -n confseq python=3.11 -y
conda activate confseq

conda install pytorch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y

pip install rdkit==2024.9.3 transformers==4.50 accelerate==1.8.1
pip install jupyter epam.indigo==1.32.0 SmilesPE==0.0.3 posebusters==0.4.4 timeout_decorator==0.5.0 fcd_torch==1.0.7 easydict==1.13 py3dmol==2.5.1 swanlab==0.6.4 lmdb==1.6.2 scikit-image==0.25.2 matplotlib==3.10.3 seaborn==0.13.2 torch_geometric==2.6.1

conda install openbabel -c conda-forge -y
conda install ninja -y

pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git"
pip install oddt==0.7
pip install ./shape_conditioned_generation/src/model/pointops
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter a CUDA version mismatch, set the following environment variables to match your installed CUDA version:
>
> ```bash
> export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.9/bin:$PATH
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.9/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
> ```
>
> If you experience issues installing `pointops`, refer to the [Pointcept issue page](https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept/issues) for troubleshooting.

Alternatively, a pre-packaged Conda environment is available [here](https://1drv.ms/u/c/940c94b59e54c472/EfXEzVb_NeNGpi6csZ0PSnAB5kSEkiqQvTMyhff1BwBmtQ?e=ZnQ8CO) for streamlined installation.

## üìù Demo

A demonstration notebook illustrating how to convert a 3D molecule to a ConfSeq sequence and reconstruct it back is provided in the `demo` directory. The core implementation of the ConfSeq algorithm is located in `demo/ConfSeq.py`.

---

## üöÄ Running the Models

The ConfSeq-series models are organized into separate directories according to their specific tasks.

- **Conformation Prediction**: All related files are located in the `/conformation_prediction/` directory.
- **Unconditional Generation**: All related files are located in the `/unconditional_generation/` directory.
- **Shape-conditioned Generation**: All related files are located in the `/shape_conditioned_generation/` directory.
- **Representation Learning**: All related files are located in the `/representation_learning/` directory.

Each directory contains a `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to run the corresponding model.

## üì¶ Resources

The datasets and pretrained model checkpoints are hosted at [this link](https://1drv.ms/f/c/940c94b59e54c472/EgN2JBqq641Mvp8zVDTM0O0Bu3wdg0YwRFZyPrYfASjBmQ?e=4YEtnZ). Please download them and place them in the appropriate directories as specified in the `README.md` files of each subdirectory.
