This is the official repository for the paper:
**‚ÄúBridging 3D Molecular Structures and Artificial Intelligence by a Conformation Description Language.‚Äù**

![Overview](./assets/overview.png)

We also provide the ready-to-use ConfSeq-series models online at [Sciminer](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/), including:
- **Molecular conformation generation**: [ConfSeq-Conf-Gen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=Confseq%20Conf%20Gen).
- **Shape-conditioned Generation**: [ConfSeq-Shape-Gen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=ConfSeq%20Shape%20Gen).
- **ConfSeq based Shape Screening**: [ConfSeq-Shape-Screen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=ConfSeq%20Shape%20Screen).

## üì¶ Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a Conda environment to install the required dependencies:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate confseq
```

## üöÄ Running the Models

The ConfSeq-series models are organized into subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific task mentioned in the paper.
The core algorithm of ConfSeq is provided in 
`ConfSeq_3_2.py`.

Please refer to the `README.md` file within each subdirectory for detailed instructions on running the respective models.
