We also provide the ready-to-use ConfSeq-series models online at [Sciminer](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/), including:
- **Molecular conformation generation**: [ConfSeq-Conf-Gen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=Confseq%20Conf%20Gen).
- **Shape-conditioned Generation**: [ConfSeq-Shape-Gen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=ConfSeq%20Shape%20Gen).
- **ConfSeq based Shape Screening**: [ConfSeq-Shape-Screen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=ConfSeq%20Shape%20Screen).

## üì¶ Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a Conda environment to install the required dependencies. The following commands will create a new Conda environment named `test` with Python 3.11 and CUDA 12.6, and install the necessary packages for running ConfSeq models.

```bash
conda create -n test python=3.11
conda activate test

conda install pytorch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install rdkit==2025.3.2 transformers==4.50 accelerate
pip install jupyter epam.indigo smilesPE posebusters timeout_decorator fcd_torch easydict py3dmol swanlab lmdb scikit-image matplotlib seaborn
conda install openbabel -c conda-forge
conda install ninja
pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git"
pip install oddt
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.9/bin:$PATH  # only if you encountered CUDA version mismatch
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.9/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  # only if you encountered CUDA version mismatch
pip install ./shape_conditioned_generation/src/model/pointops
```
We also provide a conda-packed environment in [this link](mylink) for easy setup. You can download the file and run the following command to create the environment:


## Demo

We provide a demo notebook in `demo` directory on how to use convert a 3D molecule into a ConfSeq sequence and vise versa. The detailed algorithm of ConfSeq can be found at `demo/ConfSeq.py`.

## üöÄ Running the Models

The ConfSeq-series models are organized into subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific task mentioned in the paper.
The core algorithm 

Please refer to the `README.md` file within each subdirectory for detailed instructions on running the respective models.
