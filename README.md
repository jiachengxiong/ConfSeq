We provide ready-to-use ConfSeq-series models online at [Sciminer](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/), including:

* **Molecular Conformation Generation**: [ConfSeq-Conf-Gen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=Confseq%20Conf%20Gen)
* **Shape-conditioned Generation**: [ConfSeq-Shape-Gen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=ConfSeq%20Shape%20Gen)
* **Shape Screening Based on ConfSeq**: [ConfSeq-Shape-Screen](https://sciminer.protonunfold.com/utility?tool=ConfSeq%20Shape%20Screen)

## üì¶ Environment Setup

We strongly recommend creating a dedicated Conda environment to manage dependencies. Execute the following commands to create an environment named `confseq` with Python 3.11 and CUDA 12.6:

```bash
conda create -n confseq python=3.11 -y
conda activate confseq

conda install pytorch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y

pip install rdkit==2024.9.3 transformers==4.50 accelerate==1.8.1
pip install jupyter epam.indigo==1.32.0 SmilesPE==0.0.3 posebusters==0.4.4 timeout_decorator==0.5.0 fcd_torch==1.0.7 easydict==1.13 py3dmol==2.5.1 swanlab==0.6.4 lmdb==1.6.2 scikit-image==0.25.2 matplotlib==3.10.3 seaborn==0.13.2

conda install openbabel -c conda-forge -y
conda install ninja -y

pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git"
pip install oddt==0.7
pip install ./shape_conditioned_generation/src/model/pointops
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter a CUDA version mismatch, set the following environment variables to match your installed CUDA version:
>
> ```bash
> export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.9/bin:$PATH
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.9/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
> ```
>
> If you experience issues installing `pointops`, refer to the [Pointcept issue page](https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept/issues) for troubleshooting.

Alternatively, a pre-packaged Conda environment is available [here](mylink) for streamlined installation.

## üìù Demo

A demonstration notebook illustrating how to convert a 3D molecule to a ConfSeq sequence and reconstruct it back is provided in the `demo` directory. The core implementation of the ConfSeq algorithm is located in `demo/ConfSeq.py`.

---

## üì¶ Resources

The datasets and pretrained model checkpoints are hosted at [this Zenodo link](link).

---

## üöÄ Running the Models

The ConfSeq-series models are organized into subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific task described in the paper. Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` with detailed usage instructions.

Please refer to these documents to run individual models.
