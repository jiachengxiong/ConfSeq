## ðŸ“¦ Data Preparation

We use the **DUD-E** and **PCBA** datasets to evaluate the virtual screening capability of the model.  
Additionally, molecular pair similarity data for model training are generated using **RDKit** and **LSalign**.

Raw and processed datasets can be downloaded from [your link here].
